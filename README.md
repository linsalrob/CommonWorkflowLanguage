# Common Workflow Language Examples

These  are some [common workflow language](https://www.commonwl.org) examples that we are using for [search sra](http://www.searchsra.org/). They specify different things that we can do.

# Getting started

Before you begin, you'll need a CWL parser. At the moment we're using [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) [installed](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool#install) in a Python 3.6 virtual environment.
